        "\n",
        "That is what functions cover in Python. You've already had your code do something special. Now you want to do it again. You put that special code into a function, and re-use it for all it is worth. You can refer to a function anywhere in your code, and the computer will always know what you are talking about. Handy, eh?\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, functions have their limitations. Functions don't store any information like variables do - every time a function is run, it starts afresh. However, certain functions and variables are related to each other very closely, and need to interact with each other a lot. For example, imagine you have a golf club. It has information about it (i.e. variables) like the length of the shaft, the material of the grip, and the material of the head. It also has functions associated with it, like the function of swinging your golf club, or the function of breaking it in pure frustration. For those functions, you need to know the variables of the shaft length, head material, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "That can easily be worked around with normal functions. Parameters affect the effect of a function. But what if a function needs to affect variables? What happens if each time you use your golf club, the shaft gets weaker, the grip on the handle wears away a little, you get that little more frustrated, and a new scratch is formed on the head of the club? A function cannot do that. A function only makes one output, not four or five, or five hundred. What is needed is a way to group functions and variables that are closely related into one place so that they can interact with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Chances are that you also have more than one golf club. Without classes, you need to write a whole heap of code for each different golf club. This is a pain, seeing that all clubs share common features, it is just that some have changed properties - like what the shaft is made of, and it's weight. The ideal situation would be to have a design of your basic golf club. Each time you create a new club, simply specify its attributes - the length of its shaft, its weight, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Or what if you want a golf club, which has added extra features? Maybe you decide to attach a clock to your golf club (why, I don't know - it was your idea). Does this mean that we have to create this golf club from scratch? We would have to write code first for our basic golf club, plus all of that again, and the code for the clock, for our new design. Wouldn't it be better if we were to just take our existing golf club, and then tack the code for the clock to it?\n",

These will help to orient you before we dive into the deep learning approach to these tasks. Often, deep learning is used as an approach to machine learning or as a component within a machine learning pipeline. Deep learning is also complex, ensemble method that incorporates other machine learning models or components simultaneously. For either case, familiarity with the following topics will be critical!\n",

        "One of the advantages of scikit learn is that it includes functionality to load sample datasets or generate datasets based on a stochastic process or distribution. We use the scikit-learn [make_classification function](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html) which uses an algorithm based off _I. Guyon, “Design of experiments for the NIPS 2003 variable selection benchmark”, 2003. The algorithm creates clusters of points normally distributed (std=1) about vertices of a hypercube with dimensions equal to the number of features dimensions that explain the class, and sides of length 2 times a class separation variable (default=1), then assigns an equal number of clusters to each class. It introduces interdependence between features and noise to the data. Key variables to toggle are the number of classes, number of features, number of informative features, and the class separation factor (higher is easier), etc. (see [paper](http://clopinet.com/isabelle/Projects/NIPS2003/Slides/NIPS2003-Datasets.pdf) for more details)."
