These will help to orient you before we dive into the deep learning approach to these tasks. Often, deep learning is used as an approach to machine learning or as a component within a machine learning pipeline. Deep learning is also complex, ensemble method that incorporates other machine learning models or components simultaneously. For either case, familiarity with the following topics will be critical!\n",

        "One of the advantages of scikit learn is that it includes functionality to load sample datasets or generate datasets based on a stochastic process or distribution. We use the scikit-learn [make_classification function](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html) which uses an algorithm based off _I. Guyon, “Design of experiments for the NIPS 2003 variable selection benchmark”, 2003. The algorithm creates clusters of points normally distributed (std=1) about vertices of a hypercube with dimensions equal to the number of features dimensions that explain the class, and sides of length 2 times a class separation variable (default=1), then assigns an equal number of clusters to each class. It introduces interdependence between features and noise to the data. Key variables to toggle are the number of classes, number of features, number of informative features, and the class separation factor (higher is easier), etc. (see [paper](http://clopinet.com/isabelle/Projects/NIPS2003/Slides/NIPS2003-Datasets.pdf) for more details)."
